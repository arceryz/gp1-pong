# STAR-PONG

This is the game assignment for Game Programming 1 at the Utrecht University.
The task is to create PONG, but I created STAR-PONG.

STAR-PONG is a 2-player variant of pong where both player must protect their mothership
from the bomb, while also fighting each other with bullets in space. The game tries to
be inspired by the arcade era, with sounds, shaders and pixel art to match.
